1. Define the Hyperparameter to tune.

- Windows Size
- Patch Size: ViTs use patchesâ€”optimal patch size impacts feature extraction.
- EMB_DIM
- NUM_HEADS
- NUM_LAYERS
- MLP_DIM

2. Optimization strategy

- Grid search 
- Random Search
- Bayesian Optimization
- Hyperband/ASHA 


=> I chose the Bayesian Optimization for its efficiency (Using Optuna). 

Optuna primarily uses Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) as its default optimization algorithm for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). 
TPE is a Bayesian optimization method that models the distribution of the hyperparameters as a probabilistic model, 
aiming to find the most promising regions of the search space.

Key Characteristics of TPE:
Bayesian Optimization: TPE is a type of Bayesian optimization, where it builds a probabilistic model of the objective function
 and uses it to select hyperparameters to try next. 
It learns from previous evaluations of the objective function to guide the search.
