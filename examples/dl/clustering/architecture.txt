CNN (AUTOENCODER) + KMEANS 


Goal: detect the AF and NSR in a unsupervised manner.

Final Checklist: Is the Autoencoder Learning Well?
âœ… Reconstructed ECG signals should match the original signals closely.
âœ… Reconstruction loss (MSE) should decrease over time and remain low.
âœ… Latent features (t-SNE plot) should form clear clusters instead of being random.

ðŸš€ If the model fails any of these checks, you can:

Increase/decrease the latent dimension (cfg.EMB_DIM).

Add Batch Normalization to stabilize training.

Improve data preprocessing (e.g., normalize ECG signals).

Let me know if you need help improving the results! ðŸ˜Š
